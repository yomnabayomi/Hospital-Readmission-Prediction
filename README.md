Hospital Readmission Prediction
Project Overview

The Hospital Readmission Prediction project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within 30 days after discharge based on historical medical records. This helps hospitals improve patient care, reduce unnecessary readmissions, and optimize resource allocation.

The project uses machine learning techniques to analyze diagnosis codes, medications, admission/discharge data, and patient demographics. By identifying high-risk patients, hospitals can implement preventive measures to improve outcomes.
